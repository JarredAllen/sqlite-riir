# Code of Conduct

This project presently follows the [Rust-lang Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

I reserve the right to enforce the code of conduct as I see fit, using measures including, but not limited to, deleting of offending content, kicking posters of offending content, or banning posters of offending content, either temporarily or permanently.
